# Details
[Watch the demo video on Youtube](https://youtu.be/9Kl6WDmTK8g)

This App has useful features, such as bookmarks, to save the quotes that you find motivating, and keep them in a
separated section. Moreover, there are a number of cool transition and animation affects, which makes navigation much
cooler.

Long pressing a quote in your Bookmarks copies that quote to the clipboard... More features along the way 🚀.

# Have awesome ideas?
Feel free to [Create an issue](https://github.com/GouravKhunger/QuotesApp/issues/new)

I hope you like the app :)
Stay safe... Stay Motivated ;)
